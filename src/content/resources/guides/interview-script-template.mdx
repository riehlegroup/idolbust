## Use this as a starting point

This template balances consistency with flexibility so interviewers can follow
the same structure while adapting to each participant.

## Suggested flow

1. Introductions and consent
2. Context questions
3. Task walkthrough
4. Reflection prompts
5. Wrap-up and thank you

## Adaptation notes

Keep language short and neutral. Avoid leading questions and save assumptions
for a separate notes section.
