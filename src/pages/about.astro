        Idol or Bust is a research project focused on developing simple website software 
        that helps other research projects understand their user needs.

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        We believe that understanding users is the foundation of successful research projects. 
        Our goal is to provide lightweight, maintainable tools that help researchers gather 
        insights and make data-driven decisions.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We follow a user-centered design process, constantly iterating based on feedback 
        from the research community. Our tools are built with maintainability in mind, 
        ensuring they can evolve with changing needs.
